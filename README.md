Responsive User Dashboard

A responsive and interactive user dashboard built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This application fetches user data from a mock API and displays it in a card-based layout, with additional features like search, sort, and detailed view modals. It is optimized for both desktop and mobile views, providing a seamless user experience.

Features

- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to desktop and mobile screens, displaying cards in a grid layout for larger screens and a single-column list on smaller screens.
- **Fetch User Data**: Retrieves user information from the API at [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users).
- **Search Functionality**: Filter users by name or username in real-time.
- **Sort Options**: Sort users alphabetically by name or username.
- **Interactive User Cards**: Hover effect reveals a "View Details" button on each user card.
- **Modal for Additional Details**: Displays extra user information (address, phone, website) in a modal when "View Details" is clicked.

Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure and layout of the web page.
- **CSS**: Styling for responsiveness, aesthetics, and animations.
- **JavaScript**: Functionality for fetching data, filtering, sorting, and managing modal interactions.
